Risa is an R package that is part of the ISA tools suite (http://isa-tools.org). Risa supports parsing, saving and updating ISA-tab datasets. It also builds bridges from the ISA-Tab syntax to analysis pipelines for specific assay types, such as mass spectrometry and DNA microarray assays, by building R objects from the metadata required for other packages downstream, such as xcms and affy, respectively. In addition, Risa includes functionality to suggest packages in BioConductor that might be relevant for the assay types in the ISA-TAB dataset being considered. This recommentation functionality relies on the BioCViews annotations provided by each BioConductor package.



The Risa package is available in Bioconductor:
  - [release version](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Risa.html)
  - [development version](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/Risa.html)

1. Fork it.
2. Clone your forked repository to your machine
3. Create a branch (`git checkout -b myRisa`)
4. Make your changes
5. Run the tests (`mvn clean test`)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added something useful"`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin myRisa`)
8. Create a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) from your branch.
9. Promote it. Get others to drop in and +1 it.
