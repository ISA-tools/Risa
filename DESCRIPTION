Description: The Investigation / Study / Assay (ISA) tab-delimited 
	 format is a general purpose framework with which to collect and communicate 
	 complex metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technologies used, type 
	 of measurements made) from experiments employing a combination of 
	 technologies, spanning from traditional approaches to high-throughput
	 techniques. Risa allows to access metadata/data in ISA-Tab format and 
	 build Bioconductor data structures. Currently, data generated from microarray, 
	 flow cytometry and metabolomics-based (i.e. mass spectrometry) assays are supported. 
   The package is extendable and efforts are undergoing to support metadata associated to proteomics assays.
