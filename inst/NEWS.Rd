NEWS for Risa package

Changes for 0.99.2
------------------
This is the first release version of the package. It contains functionality to parse ISAtab datasets into an R object from the ISAtab class. It also provides functionality to save the ISA-tab dataset, or each of its individual files. Additionally, it is also possible to update assay files. Currently, metadata associated to proteomics and metabolomics-based assays (i.e. mass spectrometry) can be processed into an xcmsSet object (from the xcms R package).
