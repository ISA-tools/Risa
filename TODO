What it does already:
- converting the s_ file into an R data.frame with extra columns
indicating in which isa object each sample are represented
- reading Affymetrix data, flow cytometry data
- reading 2 colours and 1 colour raw experiments
- reading xcms raw, but is it useable, see with Steffen

What it does not do yet:
- reading processed microarray data
- reading xcms processed

TODO: checks at all steps, more testings
